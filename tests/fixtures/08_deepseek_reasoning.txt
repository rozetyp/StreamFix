# Test fixture: DeepSeek style reasoning

User wants a list of programming languages. I should return them in a structured format.
The best approach is to use a JSON array with objects containing name and category.

```json
{
  "languages": [
    {"name": "Python", "category": "scripting"},
    {"name": "JavaScript", "category": "web"},
    {"name": "Rust", "category": "systems"}
  ]
}
```
