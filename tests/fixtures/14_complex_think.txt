# Test fixture: Complex think block with nested reasoning
<think>
The user is asking for a complex data structure. Let me think about this:

1. They need user information
2. They want it in JSON format  
3. I should include nested objects and arrays
4. Let me structure this properly:
   - User object with id, name, email
   - Preferences object with settings
   - Array of recent activities

Actually, let me reconsider the structure...
</think>

Here's the JSON response you requested:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "12345",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "preferences": {
      "theme": "light",
      "language": "en",
      "notifications": {
        "email": true,
        "push": false,
        "sms": false
      }
    },
    "recent_activity": [
      {"action": "login", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"},
      {"action": "profile_update", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T11:15:00Z"}
    ]
  }
}
```
